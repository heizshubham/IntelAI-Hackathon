## 📜 **Introduction**

Our project integrates **Machine Learning (ML)** with **Suricata**, an open-source intrusion detection (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS), to deliver an **AI-driven firewall solution**. This system enhances the detection of security threats by analyzing network traffic patterns, leveraging ML models to predict and identify intrusions in real-time.
